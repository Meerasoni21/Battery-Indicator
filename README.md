# Battery Indicator

I have created a Battery Indicator App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Battery Indicator provides information about the system’s battery status. A battery indicator, also known as a battery gauge, is a device that shows the status of a battery. The goal of this project is to develop a Battery Indicator App that display the current battery percentage on the screen. 


Battery indicator app should have the following layout’s:

Battery Icon: The battery icon provides information about the status of the system battery. It may be a visual indication of the battery charge level, or it may show the battery is charging or discharging current.

Progress Bar: I've made an eye-catching progress bar that makes it obvious what the battery level is. There is a horizontal progress bar visible.

Colors: I have use colors that are easy to read and visually appealing. For example, you could use green to indicate a fully charged battery, yellow for a partially charged battery, and red for a low battery.
Dark/Light Mode: Dark and light mode available in this battery indicator app.

Layout: The layout of the battery indicator app is balanced and visually appealing.

Responsive Design:  Battery indicator app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

Testing: This website ensures that it works correctly in different browsers and devices and looks good everywhere.

Code Quality: Code Quality is the clean, organized, and well-documented.
